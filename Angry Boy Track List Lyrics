TRACK LYRICS: (Without Skits)

1. ANGRY BOY
[Verse 1]:
Say I'm jealous of you
Cuz you got the fuckin money
I can't be jealous of you
If you all you are is fuckin' lucky
You don't know what it's like
To work a job and pay rent
You're crying when you're allowance is off by ten cents
I'm sittin' back while I watch you monkeys dance
While I'm shooting at the ground with a gun and you're lookin' like hammer pants
I'm livin' off minimum wage
Live in a cage
Feelin' the rage
Hittin' the stage
Yellin' estranged words and you're telling me how to behave?
I'll behave how I want
I gave me that right
Cuz I spew new shit with that true grit soon as you hand me the mic
And I don't give a fuck about your goddamn skis
I'll shove 'em both down your throat with fuckin' ease
Throw you down the slopes break your neck like a pencil
Accuse you of shit when I got no evidence against you
But I'll still be the one thrown in jail
I hate this
Why the fuck do I serve time while you give probation to rapists?
And kids are scary
So be very wary
Before a faggot chases you like that one kid McQuary
Parents don't teach their kids nowadays
Let me try
"Raping people is bad m'kay?"
Dig myself a hole big enough to be my grave
Tunnel through the states while I'm a thousand miles away
This town has always been the main source of my pain
My mom said I'd leave a mark
So I left a shit stain

[Verse 2]:
I'm an angry boy
Spittin' out this angry noise
My heads on fire like these ghost writers
But I'm bustin' em like Dan Aykroyd
I'll holdin' up this pen
While I'm blowin' up this shit



2. BAD INFLUENCES
[Verse 1]:
Wasn't born a fucked up fuck in the head
Who was fucked in the head
Instead of hugged in distress
Who's mother never must've tucked his bum into bed
Who must've had dead people stuck in his head
No but instead I was a good little kid
Never really understood what "fuck" really meant
But I never really said it cuz I knew it upset
My mother and my father who I knew would behead
Me if I didn't just tuck it
Stuck it up my ass instead of saying shit, fuck it
But shit, I was stuck it made me think I was something
They said I was nothing
Til I told 'em all to take my fucking dick and just suck it

[Hook]x2:
I just put up my defences
Here's my ten cents
It's my bad influences

[Verse 2]:
Bitch you're spittin' on me?
While we're here on the street?
Let me push you over get the tip of my feet
See, that's what my father told me
When bitches never agree
But I'm a better person now so just suck on my D
Please? Pretty please with a cherry on top?
When the feelings blowing over and you're calling the cops
And you tell them what I did but the charges were dropped
Cuz you're too afraid to tell 'em that your jaw could get clocked
But that doesn't seem like me babe
You know that it ain't
I was a good canvas
But somebody had to paint
Over the good shit about me
To try and reroute me
So you can try and get out and move on without me
But fuck that shit
I need that bitch
But this ain't a fucking movie cuz I can't act shit
Can't run that bit
Won't do jack shit
I gotta change the way I am gotta change that quick
Cuz I

[Hook]

[Verse 3]:
Fuck that shit is dope
And I'm feeling afloat
And I'm feeling some hope
Now that I'm blowin' this smoke
And nope, I don't need to put my head in a rope
Now that I'm taking a toke now and eating some soap
And I'm smokin' and I'm drinkin' even more than my friends did
And I'm doing it all just to keep things interesting
And I'm thinkin' while I'm drinkin' til I blow and intestine
And my friends that go me doing it are starting to mention
That these self destructive tendencies were not their intention
But I didn't give 'em two cents but I gave 'em my ten cents
And all a sudden my words were being effective
And the weed and the drinks were being infective
The fuck when I came up I came to my senses
I picked up all this shit where I left it
Took a couple of shots
Was being offensive
Then I started to embrace all my bad influences
Cuz I

[Hook]


3. Anything I Want To Be
[Verse 1]:
Take it back to the way that I knew it used to be
When nobody knew me and nobody used me
When nobody cared what I wrote on loose leaf
When I wrote all the lines on my pages loosely
Back before I told myself I messed up and blew it
Back to the time when I thought I could do it
Back before I caved and lost all my confidence
All the way back when I had too much tolerance
For every single time I was treated like crap
At the time I didn't know about hip-hop and rap
Back before I didn't fall for nobodies traps
Back before I fell for the game of murdering tracks
Now I just want to be alone
Isolation from life
I can do this on my own
I can fight my own fights
Realizing the light that shines on almighty might
In sight of the slight chance of doing the right

[Hook]:
You could break me but I won't take it
You could scrape me but I won't cave in
You could try blinding me from what I'd see
But I could be anything I want to be
You could break me but I won't take it
You could scrape me but I won't cave in
You could try blinding me from what I'd see
I'd still be anything I want to be

[Verse 2]:
In life we encourage being all origninal
In reality we push any individual
Destroy anybody who don't follow the rituals
Either that or they suddenly become invisible
My morals to the point where it's more than slightly
Insane, off the brink, where I'm yelling fight me
Feel the hate on my shoulders weighing more than lightly
I'm a wolf in a dogpile
I'm barking bite me
I got my eyes both set on being myself
But I ain't got a word in it cuz I'm someone else
And that other me is taking my whole life with him
At war within this shit
And I'm just killin'
But what does that mean for the real me?
When I gotta be the person that I have to be
For the survival of my whole reality
This world's driving me to insanity

[Hook]


4. FALL DOWN
[Hook]:
I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
Why do I try
I know I'm gonna fall down
Thought I could fly
But why did I drown
Never know why
It's coming down down down

[Verse 1]:
I tried but I failed to do it
Now every single day I tell myself that I just blew it
And everybody knew it
Took me a while to realize that I could never take a clue, it
Hurt too much
Burnt too much
To admit the truth, it
Killed me took the will in me to know I failed cuz I couldn't see
All the motivation my friends were giving me
Now because of me
I can never just succeed
Fuck it, B
Guess it really wasn't meant to be
My subconcious is smackin' me in the back of the head
It's saying I'm an idiot
I'm laying in bed
Thinkin' the thoughts
And getting rid of it
Livin' a lie or livin' a life
Never seeing it
Nobody ever had my back when I was feeling shit
And everything I've ever gone through
Can't keep reliving it
And everything I've ever done, too
Can't keep forgiving it
And anything I'm ever stuck to
I just keep killin' it
So I guess I'll keep flippin' the bird up my life
But I'll only keep wingin' it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
...


5. LISTEN
[Hook]:
I know there's something in the wake up of your smile
I know there's something in the look in your eyes
You built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1]:
Last time that I saw you
You left me and I lost you
Instead he ended up to
Be the one you had belonged to
But you were still in my head, voices
Never really listened to the noises
Just ignored it
But of course it was all torture
So just grab your pitchforks and your torches
Cuz I forced it
Wasn't seeing
You were leaving
Didn't even
Think I was breathing
Fuck my feelings
But I get it
You left because you knew you would regret it
Hoped to find more love but you left it
You were still in my arms in my head
But instead threw my heart in distress to forget it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
Last time that I saw you
You left me and I lost you
I never really even thought to
Pick up the phone and just call you
...


6. I DON'T NEED YOU
[Verse 1]:
Tried too hard
Gave you all I had in a month
Grew apart
Know you'll only hurt this once
Lost my feelings for you
Knowing nothing was true
But I bet when I look back at this my feelings get screwed
Take it back to the first time
The first that we me
Should've stopped there at the first lie
Wasn't hung on you yet
Now I'm regretting every moment
Every moment we spent
Cuz every moment we spent
You still hold over my head

[Hook]:
You were only playing with me
Pulled on my heart until I couldn't breathe
You know what you just put me through
You don't need me
And I don't need you


7. ANGER MANAGEMENT
[Verse 1]:
I got anger issues
If you're pissing me off expect me to hit you
