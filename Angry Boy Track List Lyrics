TRACK LYRICS

1. ANGRY BOY
[Verse 1]:
Say I'm jealous of you
Cuz you got the fuckin money
I can't be jealous of you
If you all you are is fuckin' lucky
You don't know what it's like
To work a job and pay rent
You're crying when you're allowance is off by ten cents
I'm sittin' back while I watch you monkeys dance
While I'm shooting at the ground with a gun and you're lookin' like hammer pants
I'm livin' off minimum wage
Live in a cage
Feelin' the rage
Hittin' the stage
Yellin' estranged words and you're telling me how to behave?
I'll behave however I want
I gave me that right
Cuz I spew new shit with that true grit soon as you hand me the mic
And I don't give a fuck about your goddamn skis
I'll shove 'em both down your throat with fuckin' ease
Throw you down the slopes break your neck like a pencil
Accuse you of shit when I got no evidence against you
But I'll still be the one thrown in jail
I hate this
Why the fuck do I serve time while you give probation to rapists?
And kids are scary
So be very wary
Before a faggot chases you like that one kid McQuary
Parents don't teach their kids nowadays
Let me try
"Raping people is bad m'kay?"
Dig myself a hole big enough to be my grave
Tunnel through the states while I'm a thousand miles away
This town has always been the main source of my pain
My mom said I'd leave a mark
So I left a shit stain

[Verse 2]:
I'm an angry boy
Spittin' out this angry noise
My heads on fire like these ghost writers
But I'm bustin' em like Dan Aykroyd
...


2. BAD INFLUENCES
[Verse 1]:
Wasn't born a fucked up fuck in the head
Who was fucked in the head
Instead of hugged in distress
Who's mother never must've tucked his bum into bed
Who must've had dead people stuck in his head
No but instead I was a good little kid
Never really understood what "fuck" really meant
But I never really said it cuz I knew it upset
My mother and my father who I knew would behead
Me if I didn't just tuck it
Stuck it up my ass instead of saying shit, fuck it
But shit, I was stuck it made me think I was something
They said I was nothing
Til I told 'em all to take my fucking dick and just suck it

[Hook]x2:
I just put up my defences
Here's my ten cents
It's my bad influences

[Verse 2]:
Bitch you're spittin' on me?
While we're here on the street?
Let me push you over get the tip of my feet
See, that's what my father told me
When bitches never agree
But I'm a better person now so just suck on my D
Please? Pretty please with a cherry on top?
When the feelings blowing over and you're calling the cops
And you tell them what I did but the charges were dropped
Cuz you're too afraid to tell 'em that your jaw could get clocked
But that doesn't seem like me babe
You know that it ain't
I was a good canvas
But somebody had to paint
Over the good shit about me
To try and reroute me
So you can try and get out and move on without me
But fuck that shit
I need that bitch
But this ain't a fucking movie cuz I can't act shit
Can't run that bit
Won't do jack shit
I gotta change the way I am gotta change that quick
Cuz I

[Hook]

[Verse 3]:
Fuck that shit is dope
And I'm feeling afloat
And I'm feeling some hope
Now that I'm blowin this smoke
And nope

5. LISTEN
[Hook]:
I know there's something in the wake up of your smile
I know there's something in the look in your eyes
You built a love but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark
Listen to your heart

[Verse 1]:
Last time that I saw you
You left me and I lost you
Instead he ended up to
Be the one you had belonged to
But you were still in my head, voices
Never really listened to the noises
Just ignored it
But of course it was all torture
So just grab your pitchforks and your torches
Cuz I forced it
Wasn't seeing
You were leaving
Didn't even
Think I was breathing
Fuck my feelings
But I get it
You left because you knew you would regret it
Hoped to find more love but you left it
You were still in my arms in my head
But instead threw my heart in distress to forget it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
Last time that I saw you
You left me and I lost you
I never really even thought to
Pick up the phone and just call you
...
